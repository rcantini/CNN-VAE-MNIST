# CNN-VAE-MNIST

This repository is dedicated to the development of a **Flask** web application capable of drawing digits through the use of a generative model. This model is obtained by training a **convolutional variational autoencoder** on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using **Keras** as model-level library and **TensorFlow** backend.

For further information, check out my blog post: https://riccardo-cantini.netlify.app/post/cnn_vae_mnist/

The web application, named ***Let's play with MNIST***, was deployed on Heroku and is available at this link: https://play-with-mnist.herokuapp.com/

Have fun! :laughing::laughing:
