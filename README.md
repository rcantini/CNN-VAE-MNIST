# CNN-VAE-MNIST

This repository is dedicated to the development of a **Flask** web application capable of drawing digits through the use of a generative model. This model is obtained by training a convolutional variational autoencoder on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using **Keras**+**Tensorflow**.
